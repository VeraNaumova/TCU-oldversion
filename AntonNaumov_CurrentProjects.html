	 <p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics" src="Pictures/qds.jpg" alt="QDS"><span>Gaphene quantum dots.</span> Graphene-based quantum dots, synthesized from biocompatible materials for the first time in our group provide dual-color 
	 	fluorescence imaging and sensing of cancerous environments. 
		These quantum dots can be advantageously utilized in both optoelectronics and biotechnology.</p>
		
	<p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics" src="Pictures/GO imaging.png" alt="GO Imaging"> <span>GO Imaging/drug delivery/cancer detection.</span> We selectively modify and utilize nanoscale graphene oxide (GO) 
	flakes for imaging and cancer detection in several cancer cell types including HeLa, MCF-7 and HepG2.</p>
	
	<p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics" src="Pictures/Carbon Nanotube.png" alt="Carbon Nanotube"><span>Carbon nanotube gene delivery.</span> Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) are used to deliver small interfering RNA to cells and animal tissues 
	protecting siRNA from degradation and making RNA interference gene therapy possible. SWCNTs emit light in the near-infrared, 
	where biological tissue exhibits least autofluorescence and thus are also used as imaging agents tracking pathways of gene delivery.</p>
	
	<p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics" src="Pictures/Multidrug delivery.png" alt="Multidrug Delivery by SWCNTs"><span>Multidrug delivery by SWCNTs.</span> 
	We use SWCNTs as universal carriers and imaging agents for hydrophobic drugs and sensitive gene sequences to address liver and lung diseases.</p>

	<p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics" src="Pictures/Theoretical Modeling.png" alt="Theoretical Modeling"><span>Theoretical modeling.</span> 
	We use computer molecular simulation and theoretical basis build by our group to explain optical and electronic structure of graphene derivatives, 
	such as graphene oxide, quantum dots and single-walled carbon nanotubes.</p>
	
	<p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics1" src="Pictures/Graphene Deriv.png" alt="Graphene Derivatives"><span>Graphene derivatives.</span> 
	We synthesize and study the optical and physical properties of multiple graphene derivatives starting from graphene oxide 
	and to more complex structures. The development of new graphene-based materials allows us to selectively design their unique properties 
	for novel applications. We can now controllably modify optical band gap of graphene oxide and convert reduced graphene oxide into GO and back 
	using ozone processing.</p>
	
	<p class="projectsStyle"><img class="projectPics1" src="Pictures/SWCNT.png" alt="SWCNTs in Ionic Liquids"><span>SWCNTs in ionic liquids.</span> 
	We utilize ionic liquids to selectively modify ensemble optical properties of carbon nanotubes which could be further used in device applications.</p>
	<br/>
	<p><span>Optical properties. </span>
	We study optical properties of carbon nanomaterials and perovskites for device applications in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.</p>
	
	<p class="projectsStyle"><span>Cryogenics.</span> 
	We study optical properties of materials at ultralow temperatures.</p>
