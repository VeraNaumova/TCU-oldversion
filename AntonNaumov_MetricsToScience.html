        <h2>Brief Metrics and Contribution to Science</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Over 2000 citations, H-index of 14, published in top quality journals, such as Advanced Functional Materials, JACS, ACS
            Nano and Nano Letters. These journals are of high professional quality providing substantial contribution to the field
            of nanotechnology and biotechnology.</li>
            <br>
            <li>At TCU the publication record of Naumov’s lab has experienced exponential growth giving a promise of extensive future
            developments in the world of nanomaterials and their applications.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Several external and university funding sources have been obtained in addition to large equipment donations. Acquired
            funds allowed to develop unique laboratory with capabilities of materials-characterrization and one of a kind
            hyperspectral confocal microscopy setup for visible and near-infrared fluorescence.</li>

        <h3>Optical Properties of Graphene Oxide</h3>
        <p>Naumov’s group research is focused on the optical properties of nanomaterials and their applications in
        microelectronics, biotechnology, and medicine. In 2015-2016 the work was based on exploring and altering optical
        properties of graphene oxide. We developed routes to produce graphene oxide with controlled optical properties from
        non-emissive RGO and also introduced new technique altering emission of GO by oxidation. Naumov’s lab pioneers in
        adjusting optical properties of GO since discovering its pH-dependent fluorescence in 2010 and further finding methods
        to control it. Recent endeavors are to control optical properties of graphene oxide by the electric field. This work is
        at the forefront of modern technology as it provides novel mechanisms to adjust optoelectronic properties in graphene
        oxide-based devices.</p>

        <h3>Quantum dot devices</h3>
        <p>Our lab has developed graphene quantum dots produced via a facile simple eco-friendly hydrothermal synthesis from a
        single glucosamine precursor. These nanomaterials have served as a basis of optoelectronic devices exhibiting both
        fluorescence and electroluminescence in the visible and acting as bright LEDs. Additionally the novel low-cost solar
        cells have been developed from those quantum dots with substantial power conversion efficiency. Further applications
        included UV photodetectors with excellent responsivity and detectability of all 3 UV regions (A, B and C) distinguishing
        those well from room light. These devices appear cost effective, novel and showing advantageous parameters within their
        class.</p>

        <h3>Biocompatible graphene quantum dots and their applications</h3>
        <p>Among many nanotechnology research groups working with carbon or graphene quantum dots, Naumov’s laboratory is the first
        to produce fully biocompatible graphene quantum dot structures that fluoresce in the near-infrared. This technology is a
        substantial advancement for nanomedicine: unlike many other nanomaterials these quantum dots are biocompatible at high
        concentrations, are inexpensive and simple in preparation, their near-infrared fluorescence penetrates deeper into
        biological tissue than visible fluorescence of regular fluorophores and they can be doped and chemically altered to add
        drugs and sensing moieties. The recent step of proving these nanomaterials for in vivo imaging in live mice is critical
        for their further use in biotechnology. It directly proves their use for drug circulation tracking in whole live
        animals. Because of that, these graphene quantum dots may become the most perspective out of carbon nanomaterials for
        biotech development. Development of optical sensing techniques by in the lab is based on carbon nanomaterials. Cancer
        detection enabled through change in emission spectra of graphene oxide and quantum dots is useful for intraoperative
        detection of cancer tumor boundaries and skin cancer detection. This approach is non-invasive as a benefit for patients.</p>

        <h3>Multifunctional approaches</h3>
        <p>One common advantage of nano/bio techniques developed in the lab is their multifunctionality. The lab’s research is
        always focused on bringing in multiple approaches together to provide better alternatives for medical treatment and
        diagnostics. These include development of small molecule and gene complimentary treatment for steatohepatitis, imaging
        and cancer detection by graphene oxide and quantum dots, magnetic targeting, chemotherapy treatment and dual
        fluorescence/MRI imaging by iron oxide/graphene oxide nanoparticles. Combining multiple functions in one model will aids
        in treatment and diagnostics. This trend well-explored in our works is at the frontier of nanomedicine.</p>
